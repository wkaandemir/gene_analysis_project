ABSTRACT
--------
This study presents a comprehensive comparison of machine learning algorithms
for gene expression classification. Eight different models were evaluated
using rigorous cross-validation and statistical testing methodologies.


METHODOLOGY

Dataset
-------
The gene expression dataset consists of 1000 samples 
and 500 genes. The dataset includes 
100 informative genes for classification 
between disease and healthy conditions.

Data Preprocessing
------------------
Data preprocessing included the following steps:
1. Quality control filtering to remove low-expression and high-missing genes
2. Normalization using robust
3. Feature selection using mutual_info
4. Final dataset dimensions: 600 × 47

Machine Learning Models
-----------------------
Eight machine learning algorithms were evaluated:
1. Random Forest
2. Support Vector Machine
3. Logistic Regression
4. XGBoost
5. Naive Bayes
6. K-Nearest Neighbors
7. Decision Tree
8. Deep Neural Network

Evaluation Methodology
----------------------
Model performance was evaluated using:
- 5-fold stratified cross-validation
- Multiple performance metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, MCC
- Statistical significance testing using Friedman test (α = 0.05)
- Independent test set evaluation

All experiments were conducted with random seed = 42 for reproducibility.



RESULTS

Performance Overview
--------------------
A total of 8 machine learning models were evaluated 
on 7 performance metrics. 

Best Performing Models:
- Accuracy: Random Forest (0.670)
- Balanced Accuracy: Random Forest (0.670)
- Precision: Random Forest (0.670)
- Recall: Random Forest (0.670)
- F1 Score: Random Forest (0.670)
- Mcc: Random Forest (0.340)
- Auc Roc: Random Forest (0.710)

Cross-Validation Results
------------------------
Cross-validation analysis revealed consistent performance patterns across models.
The mean accuracy across all models was 0.484 
± 0.202.

Statistical Significance
------------------------
No statistically significant differences were found between models.

Model Comparison
----------------
Detailed performance metrics are presented in Table 1. The results demonstrate
the comparative effectiveness of different machine learning approaches for
gene expression classification.


CONCLUSIONS
-----------
This comparative analysis provides insights into the relative performance
of different machine learning approaches for gene expression data analysis.
The results contribute to the understanding of optimal methodologies for
genomic classification tasks.
